# Unity.Overworld — agent entrypoint

Read the shared protocol at ..\mindattic-agent-standard\AGENTS.md, then this file, then
docs/RECONSTRUCTION.md and docs/BIBLE.md.

## What this is

A Unity 6 rebuild of *Overworld*, a VB.NET/DirectX top-down overworld game prototype. Original source: `R:\Projects\_PRE_2022\_PRE_2021\_PRE_2020\_PRE_2017\overhead 2` (the VB.NET source) together with `R:\Projects\_PRE_2022\_PRE_2021\_PRE_2020\_PRE_2017\Overworld` (a built copy with its data: books, world.mdb, gfx, audio). Rebuild from both; they split for a reason the reconstruction must find. The originals are read-only source material: never edit them.

## Rebuild standard (owner 2026-10-23)

This repo upgrades an old prototype to Unity. The gameplay is kept exactly; the code is not. Everything is
rebuilt as cutting-edge, best-practice Unity code design and organisation. Unity.SpaceGod and Unity.GridGame
are the reference architectures: read their AGENTS.md, README and docs/BIBLE.md before designing anything here.

1. **REA the original in its totality first.** Every object, script, room, sprite, sound and data file is
   reverse-engineered and recorded in docs/RECONSTRUCTION.md before it is rebuilt. Gameplay matches the original;
   where the rebuild deviates, the BIBLE says so and why.
2. **Core is pure C#.** The rules live in an engine-free Core assembly (`noEngineReferences`, no `UnityEngine`),
   tested with `dotnet test` outside Unity. State changes only through commands that produce events;
   presentation reads state and plays events, and never mutates the game.
3. **Assemblies have hard boundaries.** Core, Runtime (MonoBehaviours, presentation), Editor and Tests are separate
   asmdefs with one-way references.
4. **Content and tuning are data.** Levels, items, enemies, text and every tuning number live in data files or a
   settings registry, validated on load, not hard-coded in behaviour.
5. **Built in code, not by hand in the Editor.** Scenes, UI and objects are composed in code (or generated), so
   nothing depends on Inspector wiring the owner has to click together.
6. **Modern Unity only.** Unity 6, URP behind a pipeline-agnostic layer, the Input System, UI Toolkit or the shared
   MindAttic components, Unity.Shared profiles and settings, multiplayer-ready seams (commands carrying a player id,
   one authority, no global current-player singleton).
7. **Done means verified by play, not asserted.** Core tests green, a build that launches, and the feature seen
   working (screenshots or a scripted run) before a ticket closes.
8. **Finite.** Once every story from the reconstruction is built, the repo is a complete, polished proof of concept
   of the original, and is done.
